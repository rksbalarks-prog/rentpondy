/// starts a new "page" whenever the screen name changes, so without this the
/// entire app would be recorded as one endless screen and per-screen heatmaps
/// would be impossible.
///
/// Screen names come from `RouteSettings.name`, which [pushRoute] in routes.dart
/// sets to the web app's route path (`/my-property`, `/points-history`, …) so
/// the mobile and web dashboards use the same vocabulary. Routes pushed
/// directly with a bare `MaterialPageRoute` have no name; those fall back to the
/// route's own type rather than reporting nothing, which at least keeps the
/// screen boundary visible in the recording.
