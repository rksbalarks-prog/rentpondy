// The last two steps of the weekly run: follow-up, then bill.
//
// Billing is what actually moves a property from PreApproved to Approved — the
// bulk-bill route sets `status: 'active'`, which is what both the Approved page
// and the public feed select on. Until this existed an admin had to open
// PreApproved, press Bulk Followup, then Bulk Bill, by hand, every week.
//
// Both steps go through the app's OWN endpoints, the same two the admin screen
// posts to:
//   POST /PPC/followup-bulk-create   one follow-up per property, skips existing
//   POST /PPC/create-bill-bulk       one bill per property, skips already billed
//
// So the result is indistinguishable from a person having clicked the buttons,
// including the sequential bill numbers and the skip rules.
