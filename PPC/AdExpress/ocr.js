// What changes against vision.js:
//   - no API key, no tokens, no tokens-per-minute ceiling, no 429s
//   - a page of 66 boxes reads in about half a minute instead of three minutes
//   - the three independent phone readings come from three different pixel
//     treatments of the crop rather than three different prompts
//
// What deliberately does NOT change:
//   - a phone number is published only when every reading agrees (resolvePhones
//     in normalize.js decides that, exactly as before)
//   - a box that cannot be classified comes back with dealType 'unknown', which
//     normalizeAd turns into an issue so a person sees it
//   - the reviewer still confirms against the saved crop image
//
// `usage` is reported as zeros so the job counters, the admin screen and the
// run history keep working unchanged — they simply now record that an issue
// cost nothing to read.
