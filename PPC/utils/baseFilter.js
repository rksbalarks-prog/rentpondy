/**
 * City-base filtering helper.
 *
 * The platform serves two cities, identified by a `base` code on each
 * property / buyer / user document:
 *   'PY' = Pondicherry   (the original city)
 *   'CH' = Chennai
 *
 * Legacy documents created before this feature have NO `base` field at all.
 * They belong to Pondicherry, so the 'PY' filter intentionally also matches
 * documents where `base` is null or missing. This keeps Pondicherry views
 * correct even if the one-time backfill migration has not been run yet.
 *
 * The 'CH' filter is strict: it matches only documents explicitly tagged 'CH'.
 *
 * Any other value (including 'ALL', undefined, or empty) returns an empty
 * filter `{}`, meaning "no city restriction" — used by the admin ALL view and
 * by every endpoint that does not send a base.
